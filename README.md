# Mini Metro Clone
A small and unfinished clone of the video game Mini Metro by Dinosaur Polo Club written in Java. Currently, you can place stations on the map and connect them with a line. Then a train will spawn and travel along this line, picking up passengers and dropping them off at their destination stations.
